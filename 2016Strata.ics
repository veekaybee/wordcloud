SUMMARY:Conquer the time series data pipeline with SMACK
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Patrick McFadin (DataStax). We as an industry a
 re collecting more data every year. IoT, web, and mobile applications se
 nd torrents of bits to our data centers that have to be processed and st
 ored, while users expect an always-on experience—leaving little room for
  error. Patrick McFadin explores how successful companies do this every 
 day with powerful data pipelines built with SMACK: Spark, Mesos, Akka, C
 assandra, and Kafka.

SUMMARY:Designing a location intelligence platform for everyone by integ
 rating data, analysis, and cartography
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Stuart Lynn (CartoDB), Andy Eschbacher (CARTO).
  Geospatial analysis can provide deep insights into many datasets. Unfor
 tunately the key tools to unlocking these insights—geospatial statistics
 , machine learning, and meaningful cartography—remain inaccessible to no
 ntechnical audiences. Stuart Lynn and Andy Eschbacher explore the design
  challenges in making these tools accessible and integrated in an intuit

SUMMARY:Smart data for smarter firefighters
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Bart van Leeuwen (Netage). Smart data allows fi
 re services to better protect the people they serve and keep their firef
 ighters safe. The combination of open and nonpublic data used in a smart
  way generates new insights both in preparation and operations. Bart van
  Leeuwen discusses how the fire service is benefiting from open standard

SUMMARY:An introduction to Druid
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Fangjin Yang (Imply). Cluster computing framewo
 rks such as Hadoop or Spark are tremendously beneficial in processing an
 d deriving insights from data. However, long query latencies make these 
 frameworks suboptimal choices to power interactive applications. Fangjin
  Yang discusses using Druid for analytics and explains why the architect
 ure is well suited to power analytic dashboards.

SUMMARY:Smart data for smarter firefighters
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Bart van Leeuwen (Netage). Smart data allows fi
 re services to better protect the people they serve and keep their firef
 ighters safe. The combination of open and nonpublic data used in a smart
  way generates new insights both in preparation and operations. Bart van
  Leeuwen discusses how the fire service is benefiting from open standard
 s and best practices.

SUMMARY:An introduction to Druid
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Fangjin Yang (Imply). Cluster computing framewo
 rks such as Hadoop or Spark are tremendously beneficial in processing an
 d deriving insights from data. However, long query latencies make these 
 frameworks suboptimal choices to power interactive applications. Fangjin
  Yang discusses using Druid for analytics and explains why the architect
 ure is well suited to power analytic dashboards.

SUMMARY:Statistics and the art of deception
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Deborah Berebichez (Metis). Data scientists use
  statistics to reach meaningful conclusions about data. Unfortunately, s
 tatistical tools are often misapplied, resulting in errors that cost bot

SUMMARY:Why should I trust you? Explaining the predictions of machine-le
 arning models
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Carlos Guestrin (Apple | University of Washingt
 on ). Despite widespread adoption, machine-learning models remain mostly
  black boxes, making it very difficult to understand the reasons behind 
 a prediction. Such understanding is fundamentally important to assess tr
 ust in a model before we take actions based on a prediction or choose to
  deploy a new ML service. Carlos Guestrin offers a general approach for 
 explaining predictions made by any ML model.

SUMMARY:Removing complexity from scalable machine learning
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Martin Wicke (Google). Much of the success of d

 and more computing power—but scale can quickly become a problem. Distrib

 rd to debug, and hard to profile and optimize. Martin Wicke demonstrates
  how to automate or abstract away such complexity, using TensorFlow as a
 n example.

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Danielle Dean (Microsoft), Shaheen Gauher (Micr

  an equipment failure. In real scenarios, this is usually a rare event. 
 Unless the data collection has been taking place over a long period of t
 ime, the data will have very few of these events or, in the worst case, 
 none at all. Danielle Dean and Shaheen Gauher discuss the various ways o
 f building and evaluating models for such data.

SUMMARY:Why should I trust you? Explaining the predictions of machine-le
 arning models
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Carlos Guestrin (Apple | University of Washingt
 on ). Despite widespread adoption, machine-learning models remain mostly
  black boxes, making it very difficult to understand the reasons behind 
 a prediction. Such understanding is fundamentally important to assess tr
 ust in a model before we take actions based on a prediction or choose to
  deploy a new ML service. Carlos Guestrin offers a general approach for 
 explaining predictions made by any ML model.

SUMMARY:Removing complexity from scalable machine learning
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Martin Wicke (Google). Much of the success of d
 eep learning in recent years can be attributed to scale—bigger datasets 
 and more computing power—but scale can quickly become a problem. Distrib
 uted, asynchronous computing in heterogenous environments is complex, ha
 rd to debug, and hard to profile and optimize. Martin Wicke demonstrates
  how to automate or abstract away such complexity, using TensorFlow as a
 n example.

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Danielle Dean (Microsoft), Shaheen Gauher (Micr

  an equipment failure. In real scenarios, this is usually a rare event. 
 Unless the data collection has been taking place over a long period of t

 none at all. Danielle Dean and Shaheen Gauher discuss the various ways o
 f building and evaluating models for such data.

 ets a lot of attention, we only think about two languages being supporte
 d—Python and Scala. Jesse Anderson proves that Java works just as well. 
 With lambdas, we even get syntax comparable to Scala, so Java developers
  get the best of both worlds without having to learn Scala.

SUMMARY:Top five mistakes when writing Spark applications
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ted Malaska (Cloudera), Mark Grover (Cloudera).
  Ted Malaska and Mark Grover cover the top five things that prevent Spar
 k developers from getting the most out of their Spark clusters. When the
 se issues are addressed, it is not uncommon to see the same job running 
 10x or 100x faster with the same clusters and the same data, using just 
 a different approach.

SUMMARY:Tuning Spark machine-learning workloads
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Raj Krishnamurthy (IBM). Spark's efficiency and
  speed can help reduce the TCO of existing clusters. This is because Spa
 rk's performance advantages allow it to complete processing in drastical
 ly shorter batch windows with higher performance per dollar. Raj Krishna
 murthy offers a detailed walk-through of an alternating least squares-ba
 sed matrix factorization workload able to improve runtimes by a factor o
